CALL FOR PAPERS - IWESEP 2017


The 8th International Workshop on Empirical Software Engineering
in Practice
https://iwesep2017.github.io/


March 13, 2017, Tokyo, Japan
Co-located with ICST 2017
*****************************************************************************

The objective of the 8th International Workshop on Empirical Software
Engineering in Practice (IWESEP) is to foster the development of the area by
providing a forum where researchers and practitioners can report on and discuss
new research results and applications in the area of empirical software
engineering. The workshop encourages the exchange of ideas within the
international community to better understand, from an empirical viewpoint, the
strengths and weaknesses of technology in use and new technologies, with the
expectation of furthering the field of software engineering.


The workshop focuses on the process, design, and structure of empirical studies
as well as the results of specific studies. The workshop welcomes both original
and replicated studies, varying from controlled experiments to field studies,
from quantitative to qualitative. We solicit the following two types of
submissions: full research papers (max 6 pages) for oral presentations and
abstracts (max 700 words) for poster presentations. Please check the website for
more information.

Accepted research papers will be published in the conference proceedings with an IEEE catalog number and ISBN number. 
The proceedings will be submitted to IEEE Xplore for publication.


Note that IWESEP 2017 is organized independently from ICST 2017 official workshops.
